A simple but good looking Online Calculator

This is a simple but good looking Online Calculator, which I created mostly because the default Calculator from Operating Systems
(Windows, Linux, Mac etc.) looks really basic, and sometimes boring.
And because i wanted to put the Calculator on my Website i created it in HTML(for the body), CSS(for Styling and the GUI) and Javascript
(For making the Calculator work like it should).
