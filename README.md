A simple but good looking Online Calculator

This is a simple but good looking Online Calculator, which I created mostly because the default Calculator from Operating Systems
(Windows, Linux, Mac etc.) look really basic and sometimes boring.
Also I wanted to put the Calculator on my Website. I created it in HTML (for the body), CSS (for Styling and the GUI) and Javascript
(for making the Calculator work like it should).
